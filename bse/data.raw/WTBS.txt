The well-tempered formula is a modification of the even-tempered formula,
originally recommended by Reeves and explored by Ruendenberg and coworkers
[for complete references, see Chem. Phys. Lett. 212, 260 (1993)].  In the
well-tempered formula there are only four parameters (which need to be
optimized) for each atom in the periodic table.  The values of exponential
parameters are shared between the angular symmetries, thus reducing the
effort required in the optimization of basis sets.  Usually, the higher
angular subspaces use only a subset of the complete pool of exponential
parameters defined by N; in consequence, the well-tempered basis sets
contain a hidden parameter, the pattern of sharing the exponents between
the s, p, d, and f symmetries.  Savings in the computing time may be
achieved especially in the evaluation of energy derivatives with the
integral codes which utilize the sharing of the exponents between the
atomic angular symmetries (e.g. GAMESS, HONDO, or Gaussian).

Users can split off individual diffuse primitives for added flexibility.
