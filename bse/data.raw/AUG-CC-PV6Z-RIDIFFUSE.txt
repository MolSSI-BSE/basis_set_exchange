FROM DESCRIPTION:
----------------
Diffuse function for the cc-pV6Z and cc-pV(6+d)Z
auxiliary basis sets for correlated calculations
with second-order methods
using the resolution-of-the-identity approximation
as e.g. RI-MP2, RI-CC2, RI-CIS(D), RI-ADC(2), etc.
The full aug-cc-pV6Z-RI and aug-cc-pV(6+d)Z-RI
auxiliary basis sets are obtained by augmenting the valence
auxiliary basis sets with these diffuse functions.
