FROM DESCRIPTION:
----------------
This basis set is the same as MINI (scaled) on the EMSL. Reference:

Valence scale factors from John Deisz of North Dakota State University.
The basis-set incompletness potentials (BSIP) provided with it are
designed to improve the description of non-covalent interactions and
intra- and inter-molecular geometries from MINI (scaled)
calculations by removing basis-set incompletness error. BSIPs have
been developed for use with DFT methods. BSIPs are described in:
 A. Otero-de-la-Roza and Gino A. DiLabio, J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2017, 13 (8), pp 3505-3524
The BSIP1 label refers to these BSIPs being the first version
developed, for atoms H, C, N, O, F, P, S, and Cl.
