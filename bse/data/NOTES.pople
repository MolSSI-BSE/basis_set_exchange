Notes about Pople basis sets
============================

There are a few types - 3-21G, 4-31G, 5-21G, 5-31G, 6-21G, 6-31G. Of
these, only 3-21G and 6-31G are regularly used.

5-21G is only included in the original BSE due to Gaussian using it for
Li and B for the "4-31G" basis set. I believe they are rarely used.

For hydrogen and helium, there is no split core/valence. Therefore,
4-31G, 5-31G, and 6-31G are all equivalent for H and He. These basis
sets are stored in the 31G-* files.

For beryllium, the 5-21G/6-31G basis sets given in dill1975a were
superseded by ones given in binkley1977a. The original data from dill1975a
is not included in the new BSE.

For 6-31G, the basis sets for potassium and calcium were originally
given in rassolov1998a, along with d-type polarization functions with an
exponent of 0.2000.  Rassolov2001a updates these basis sets, adding extra
d functions to the valence. In doing so, the d-type polarization functions
were also updated, to be 1/4 the smallest valence d function.  As far
as I know, the diffuse functions have not been updated.

There does not appear to be diffuse functions available for helium.

For Na-Ar (Z=11-18), 6-31G uses the same core as 6-21G (gorodon1982a)
with a different valence (francl1982a). This is the only piece of 6-21G
that is included in the BSE.

TODO: INSERT NOTE ABOUT HE,NE COMING FROM GAUSSIAN


3-21G basis
-----------

3-21G was developed later, and uses pieces of the Huzinaga MINI basis set for the
core and some valence.


Differences/Issues with the original BSE
----------------------------------------

The original BSE sometimes truncates to a fixed number of decimal places, removing
significant figures. 

In the original BSE, the H basis for 6-31G and 4-31G differ slightly,
possibly due to transcription error. The 6-31G basis set for H in
GAMESS and Gaussion both agree with the basis set given in 4-31G in the
original BSE.

The original BSE was missing the modified potassium and calcium given in rassolov2001a.
