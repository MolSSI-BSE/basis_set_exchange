FROM DESCRIPTION:
----------------
The 6-311G-J basis sets developed by Kj&#230;r and Sauer are modifications of the 6-311G basis sets by Pople and co-workers
(R. Krishnan, J.S. Binkley, R. Seeger and J.A. Pople, J. Chem. Phys. 72, 650 (1980)).
They were optimized for the calculation of Fermi contact dominated NMR indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling constants at the level of density functional theory with the B3LYP exchange-correlation functional.
Currently the basis sets exist for:
H, C, N, O
The composition of the basis sets are:
for H:          (8s) contracted to [6s]
for C, N, O: (14s6p) contracted to [8s3p] 
The references for the basis sets are:
