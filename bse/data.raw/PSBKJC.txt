FROM DESCRIPTION:
----------------
Sadlej&apos;s electric polarization method of Gaussian basis functions was applied to the double-zeta effective core potential basis sets of Stevens, Basch, Krauss, Jasien and Cundari to generate a new augmented polarized valence double-zeta set, 
named as pSBKJC, which is appropriate for the calculation of dynamic polarizabilities and Raman intensities. 
The pSBKJC basis set was developed for the atoms of families 14 to 17 
(from C to F, Si to Cl, Ge to Br and Sn to I).
