The atomic natural orbital basis sets of Almlof, Taylor and coworkers are
based on atomic valence SD-CI densities or densities derived from state-
averaged MR SD-CI calculations.  The aim was to derive generally contracted
sets with large numbers of Gaussian primitives without significant loss in
the SCF or correlation energy. Choices of what mixture of s,p,d,f,g
functions to group together were based on the natural orbital occupation
numbers.
