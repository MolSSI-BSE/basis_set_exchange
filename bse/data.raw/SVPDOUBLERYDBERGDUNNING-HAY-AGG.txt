The Dunning-Hay split valence basis sets are moderate sized segmented
contractions, which can be used efficiently in programs that don't support
general contractions.  The single shell of Rydberg functions is designed to
describe the n = 3 and n = 4 states of first row atoms.
For Ne (where exponents were not given by Dunning & Hay) the
values were estimated on the basis of neighboring elements.
