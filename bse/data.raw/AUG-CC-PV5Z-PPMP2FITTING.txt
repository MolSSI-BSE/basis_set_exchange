FROM DESCRIPTION:
----------------
Auxiliary basis set to be used with the aug-cc-pV5Z-PP AO basis set in MP2 density fitting 
MP2 auxiliary basis for use with aug-cc-pV5Z-PP AO basis set. It should be noted that this auxiliary basis contains exponents with angular momentum &gt; i and this may not be supported in all packages. 
Auxiliary basis set for density fitting in MP2, matched to the aug-cc-pV5Z-PP basis set. Diffuse functions only.
