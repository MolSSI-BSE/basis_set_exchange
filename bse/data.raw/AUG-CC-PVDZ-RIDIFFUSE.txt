FROM DESCRIPTION:
----------------
Diffuse function for the cc-pVDZ, cc-pV(D+d)Z, or cc-pwCVDZ
auxiliary basis sets for correlated calculations
with second-order methods
using the resolution-of-the-identity approximation
as e.g. RI-MP2, RI-CC2, RI-CIS(D), RI-ADC(2), etc.
The full aug-cc-pVDZ-RI, aug-cc-pV(D+d)Z-RI, and aug-cc-pwCVDZ-RI
auxiliary basis sets are obtained by augmenting the (core+)valence auxiliary basis sets with these diffuse functions.
