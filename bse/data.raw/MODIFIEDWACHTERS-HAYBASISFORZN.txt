FROM DESCRIPTION:
----------------
The B2 basis set for Zn was defined by Amin and Truhlar. 
It is a modification of the Wachters-Hay basis for Zn as 
implemented in Gaussian03, which is the basis that one gets 
for Zn if one specifies 6-311+G(d,p) in Gaussian03.  The 
Gaussian 03 version Wachters-Hay basis set is called basis 
set B1, and it involves using the contraction scheme of 
Raghavachari and Trucks, with diffuse functions added by R
aghavachari and Trucks, Wachters's optimized diffuse p-functions, 
and Hay's optimized diffuse d-function. Raghavachari and Trucks 
described both an ?spd? basis and an ?spdf? basis. The basis used 
in B1 is the spd basis further polarized with a single f set with
an exponent of 1.62. As a result the B1 Zn basis consists of a 
15s11p6d1f primitive basis contracted to 10s7p4d1f, with the 
outer functions uncontracted. Amin and Truhlar augmented the B1 
basis with two additional f-functions (with exponents of 0.486 
and 5.40) specified by Raghavachari and Trucks; this augmentation 
yields the present B2 basis.
