Basis Set Exchange - Library
==============================================

This project is the data repository for basis sets found in quantum
chemistry, plus a library for reading and manipulating the basis sets.

This library is written as part of a rewrite of the Basis Set Exchange
(https://www.basissetexchange.org) and is a collaboration between the
Molecular Sciences Software Institute (https://molssi.org) and the
Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (https://www.emsl.pnl.gov)

The code for this project is located on GitHub at
https://github.com/MolSSI-BSE/basis_set_exchange
