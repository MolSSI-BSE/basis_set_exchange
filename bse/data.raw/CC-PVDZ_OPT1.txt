FROM DESCRIPTION:
----------------
   Correlation Consistent Polarized Valence Double Zeta (cc-pVDZ) Basis
    These basis functions have been converted to segmented contractions
    and transformed to reduce the length of the contractions.

The basic idea behind the correlation consistent basis sets is that functions
which contribute approximately the same amount of correlation energy should
be grouped together when considering what mixture of s,p,d,.. etc basis
functions to use.  For hydrogen the polarization exponents were determined by
optimizing them at the SD-CI level for molecular hydrogen in its ground
state.  The (s,p) exponents for B - Ne were optimized in atomic Hartree-
Fock calculations on the ground state.  The polarization exponents were
optimized at the SD-CI level.

The Gaussian elimination algorithm used to reduce the contraction lengths was
described in an article by E.R. Davidson (Chem. Phys. Lett. 260, 514 (1996)).
In practice, the amount of savings will depend upon the calculation being
performed and the application.  For example, an RHF + gradient calculation
with Gaussian 94 on an SGI R10000 CPU with the cc-pVDZ basis set produced the
following:
                                       SCF+Gradient
Molecule=C6H6 (benzene)                  CPU (sec)
Original format (as in G94)              126
Breaking apart the individual primitives  84
Current optimized format                  77
Energies differed by ~10**-9 Hartree and gradients differed by ~0.00001 Eh/ao.
