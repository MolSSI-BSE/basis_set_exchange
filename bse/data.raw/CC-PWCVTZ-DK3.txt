FROM DESCRIPTION:
----------------
Correlation consistent basis set contracted for the 3rd-order Douglas-Kroll-Hess scalar relativistic Hamiltonian. This set can also be used in 2nd-order DKH calculations as well with minimal loss of accuracy. These sets are designed for correlation of the outer-core 4s4p4d and valence 4f5s5p5d6s electrons
See the cited reference for representative benchmark calculations.
