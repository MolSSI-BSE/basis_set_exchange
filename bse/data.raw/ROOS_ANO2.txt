The ANO basis sets of Widmark, Malmqvist and Roos are based on atomic valence
SD-CI's. However, in contrast to the ANO contractions of Almlof and Taylor,
these contractions were based not just on the atomic ground states, but on
the positive and negative ions and electric field polarized atom as well.
Additional low-lying electronic states were included for some atoms.  For
example, the singlet D state of oxygen was included in the averaging process.
The Gaussian primitive set is based on the van Duijneveldt (13s,8p) set.
The primitives for the transition metals were based on the [20s,12p,9d] set
set of H. Partridge, J. Chem. Phys., 90, 1043 (1989).
