The correlation consistent core-valence basis sets extend the ideas of the
original cc-pVxZ sets by including extra functions designed for core-core and
core-valence correlation.
The basic idea behind the correlation consistent basis sets is that
functions which contribute approximately the same amount of correlation
energy should be grouped together.
The SD-CI energies quoted below are for valence CI's.  However, unlike
the SD-CI's for the smaller basis sets these calculations used just a
single reference configuration.  With the smaller sets the SD-CI
energies were obtained with a symmetry equivalenced reference space.
For example, for carbon all 3 p(2) configurations were used in the
reference space.
