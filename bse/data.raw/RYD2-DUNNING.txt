The first shell of Rydberg functions is designed to describe the 3s, 3p and
3d states of first row atoms and the 4s, 4p and 3d states of the next row.  For Ne and Ar (where exponents were not given by Dunning & Hay) the values were
estimated on the basis of neighboring elements.  The second shell of Rydberg
functions is intended for the 4s, 4p and 4d states of first row elements.
Corresponding 5s, 5p 4d exponents were not given in the paper by Dunning & Hay,
but were estimated here by scaling the second Rydberg exponents for first row
elements by the ratio of the 3s (first row)/4s (second row).
