The ANO basis sets of Widmark, Malmqvist, Persson and Roos are based on
atomic valence SD-CI's. However, in contrast to the ANO contractions of
Almlof and Taylor, these contractions were based not just on the atomic
ground states, but on the positive and negative ions and electric field
polarized atom as well.

Additional low-lying electronic states were included for some atoms.  For
example, the singlet D state of oxygen was included in the averaging process.

The Gaussian primitive set for first row elemets is based on the van
Duijneveldt (13s,8p) set augmented with a extra shell of diffuse functions. The
second row sets were derived in an analogous fashion from a (16s,11p) set.
The primitives for the transition metals were based on the [20s,12p,9d] set
set of H. Partridge, J. Chem. Phys., 90, 1043 (1989).
