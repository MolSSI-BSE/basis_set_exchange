The basic idea behind the correlation consistent basis sets is that functions
which contribute approximately the same amount of correlation energy should
be grouped together when considering what mixture of s,p,d,.. etc basis
functions to use.  For hydrogen the polarization exponents were determined by
optimizing them at the SD-CI level for molecular hydrogen in its ground
state.  The (s,p) exponents for B - Ne were optimized in atomic Hartree-
Fock calculations on the ground state.  The polarization exponents were
optimized at the SD-CI level.
Note that the Ga - Kr basis sets are intended for use with a 14 orbital
frozen core, i.e. (1s,2s,2px,2py,2pz,3s,3px,3py,3pz,3d(z2),3d(x2-y2),3dxy,
3dxz,3dyz) atomic orbitals. This is not the default in Gaussian, which
keeps the 3d space active.

The atomic set was obtained by optimizing the (s,p)-exponents in Hartree-Fock 
calculations on the ground, (4)S, state of nitrogen. The polarization set was 
obtained by optimizing the (d,f,g)-exponents in HF+1+2 calculations on the 
(4)S state: first the d-exponents were optimized in the absence of the f- and
g-functions; then the f-functions were added to the set and their exponents
optimized; finally, the g-function was added to the set and its exponent
optimized.

The basic idea behind the correlation consistent basis sets is that
functions which contribute approximately the same amount of correlation
energy should be grouped together.
The SD-CI energies quoted below are for valence CI's.
