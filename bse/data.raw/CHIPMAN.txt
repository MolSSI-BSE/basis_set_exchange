      H: (6s,1p)     -> [4s,1p]    D. Chipman, Theor. Chim. Acta 76, 73 (1989).
  B - F: (10s,6p,2d) -> [6s,3p,2d]

This collection of basis functions for first row elements was developed as
a modest-sized alternative to more extended basis sets (which are,
therefore, more costly to use).  The exponents began with the (9s,5p/4s)
energy optimized sets of Huzinaga and Dunning's DZ contraction coefficients.
To these were added a set of diffuse (s,p) functions for elements B - F,
and a tighter inner s function on hydrogen.  Finally, a set of two d-type
polarization functions were added.  These contractions were designed to mimic
numerical spin density results obtained with an MCSCF procedure.

Note: This basis set uses 5-component d functions.
