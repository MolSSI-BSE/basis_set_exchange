FROM DESCRIPTION:
----------------
The 6-31+G*-J basis sets developed by Kj&#230;r and Sauer are modifications of the 6-31+G* basis sets by Pople and co-workers
(W.J. Hehre, R. Ditchfield and J.A. Pople, J. Chem. Phys. 56, 2257 (1972)
P.C. Hariharan and J.A. Pople, Theoret. Chimica Acta 28, 213 (1973)
T. Clark, J. Chandrasekhar, G.W. Spitznagel and P. von R. Schleyer, J. Comp. Chem. 4, 294 (1983)).
They were optimized for the calculation of Fermi contact dominated NMR indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling constants at the level of density functional theory with the B3LYP exchange-correlation functional.
Currently the basis sets exist for:
H, C, N, O
The composition of the basis sets are:
for H:          (7s) contracted to [4s]
for C, N, O: (14s6p1d) contracted to [7s3p1d]
The references for the basis sets are:
