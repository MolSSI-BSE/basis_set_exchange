The Dunning-Hay split valence basis sets are moderate sized segmented
contractions, which can be used efficiently in programs that don't support
general contractions.  The single shell of Rydberg functions is designed to
describe the n = 3 states of first row atoms.  The diffuse exponents were
optimized at the SCF level for the negative ions.
For H, Li, Be and Ne (where exponents were not given by Dunning & Hay) the
values were estimated on the basis of neighboring elements or by assuming
an even-tempered extension.
