The basic idea behind the correlation consistent basis sets is that functions
which contribute approximately the same amount of correlation energy should
be grouped together when considering what mixture of s,p,d,.. etc basis
functions to use.  For hydrogen the polarization exponents were determined by
optimizing them at the SD-CI level for molecular hydrogen in its ground
state.  The (s,p) exponents for B - Ne were optimized in atomic Hartree-
Fock calculations on the ground state.  The polarization exponents were
optimized at the SD-CI level.
Note that the Ga - Kr basis sets are intended for use with a 14 orbital
frozen core, i.e. (1s,2s,2px,2py,2pz,3s,3px,3py,3pz,3d(z2),3d(x2-y2),3dxy,
3dxz,3dyz) atomic orbitals. This is not the default in Gaussian, which
keeps the 3d space active.

from higher l-value functions that are present in atomic calculations performed
in D2h symmetry were removed.  For example, the d0 and d2+ contaminants present
in the s irrep were removed.

Exponents for the (s)-functions taken from the calculations of Duijneveldt,
IBM Research Report RJ 945 (1971).  The polarization set was obtained by
optimizing the (p,d)-exponents in HF+1+2 calculations on the (1)Sigmag(+)
state of molecular hydrogen: first the p-exponents were optimized in the 
absence of the d-function;then the d-function was added to the set and its
exponent optimized.
The HF+1+2 calculations were carried out in D(2h) symmetry.

The atomic set was obtained by optimizing the (s)-exponents in Hartree-Fock 
calculations on the ground, (1)S, state of helium,  The polarization set was
obtained by optimizing the (p,d)-exponents in HF+1+2 calculations on the (1)S
state: first the p-exponents were optimized in the absence of the d-function
then the d-function was added to the set and its exponent optimized.
The HF+1+2 calculations were carried out in D(2h) symmetry.
