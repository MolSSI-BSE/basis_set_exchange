FROM DESCRIPTION:
----------------
The 6-31G-J basis sets developed by Kj&#230;r and Sauer are modifications of the 6-31G basis sets by Pople and co-workers
(W.J. Hehre, R. Ditchfield and J.A. Pople, J. Chem. Phys. 56, 2257 (1972)).
They were optimized for the calculation of Fermi contact dominated NMR indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling constants at the level of density functional theory with the B3LYP exchange-correlation functional.
Currently the basis sets exist for:
H, C, N, O
The composition of the basis sets are:
for H:          (7s) contracted to [4s]
for C, N, O: (13s5p) contracted to [6s2p]
The references for the basis sets are:
