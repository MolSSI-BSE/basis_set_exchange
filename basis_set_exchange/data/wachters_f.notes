Note from BPP: diffuse p and f were also added by bauschlicher1989a. The extra d
               functions come from hay1977a.

To perform ab initio calculation for transition metalhalogenides or -chalcogenidcs 
of general geometry one must still resort to Gaussian basis functions for the expansion 
of the molecular orbitals in the wavefunction. 
The f functions are contracted (3f)/[1f]. You can split off the last f for a
(3f)/[2f] contraction.  The contraction coefficients are from a three term fit
to an STO with exponents of 1.6(Sc) to 4.8(Cu) in steps of 0.4.  It is easy
to replace (3f) with (1f) using Stewards fits.
For Sc and Ti the 3s and 3p orbitals sometimes mix with ligands which are
bound to the metal.  You can get around this by changing the 3p contraction
to 3311111 and correlate the metal 3s and 3p.
