FROM DESCRIPTION:
----------------
tight functions for te cc-pV5Z and aug-cc-pV5Z
auxiliary basis sets for correlated calculations
with second-order methods
using the resolution-of-the-identity approximation
as e.g. RI-MP2, RI-CC2, RI-CIS(D), RI-ADC(2), etc.
The full cc-pwCV5Z-RI and aug-cc-pwCV5Z-RI auxiliary 
basis sets are obtained by augmenting the valence auxiliary
basis sets with these tight functions
