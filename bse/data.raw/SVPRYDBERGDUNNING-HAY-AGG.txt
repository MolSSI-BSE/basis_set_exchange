The Dunning-Hay split valence basis sets are moderate-sized segmented
contractions, which can be used efficiently in programs that don't support
general contractions.  The single shell of Rydberg functions is designed to
describe the n = 3 states of first row atoms and n=4 states of the next row.
For Ne and Ar (where exponents were not given by Dunning & Hay) the
values were estimated on the basis of neighboring elements.
