These basis sets are a bit esoteric, but are from
schafer1992a, with polarization added in gauss1993a.
These come from cfour's GENBAS file.

I am making up the family/prefix jgauss to differentiate it
from all the other basis sets with the form XZP XVP etc.

Some of the sets from schafer1992a do exist in turbomole, but
named just for the contraction pattern (ie, (11s7p)[6s4p]).
