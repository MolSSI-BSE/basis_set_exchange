FROM DESCRIPTION:
----------------
NMR-DKH (TZ2P character) basis set for H-He, Li-Ne, Na-Ar, K-Ca, Ga-Kr, Rb-Sr, In-Xe and Pt atoms.
The new basis sets identified as NMR-DKH were partially contracted as a triple-zeta doubly polarized scheme with all coefficients obtained from a Douglas&#8211;Kroll&#8211;Hess (DKH) second-order scalar relativistic calculation.
The NMR-DKH basis set was tested in the prediction of the Pt-195 NMR chemical shift. For a set of 258 Pt(II) complexes, a mean absolute deviation of 168 ppm and a mean relative deviation of 5% were found.
