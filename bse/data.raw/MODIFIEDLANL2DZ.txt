Although the (n + 1)p orbital is unoccupied in transition-metal ground-state
configurations which are all nd(x)(n + l)s(y), these (n + l)p functions play a
crucial role in the structure of transition metal complexes. 
This basis set offers a set of properly optimized (n + l)p functions that offer a more compact and satisfactory solution to the proper placements of the (n + 1)p node.
The new optimized (n + l)p function performs well compared to a fully uncontracted basis set.
