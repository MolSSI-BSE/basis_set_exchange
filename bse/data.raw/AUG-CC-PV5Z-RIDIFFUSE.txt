FROM DESCRIPTION:
----------------
Diffuse function for the cc-pV5Z, cc-pV(5+d)Z, or cc-pwCV5Z
auxiliary basis sets for correlated calculations
with second-order methods
using the resolution-of-the-identity approximation
as e.g. RI-MP2, RI-CC2, RI-CIS(D), RI-ADC(2), etc.
The full aug-cc-pV5Z-RI, aug-cc-pV(5+d)Z-RI, and aug-cc-pwCV5Z-RI
auxiliary basis sets are obtained by augmenting the (core+)valence
auxiliary basis sets with these diffuse functions.
