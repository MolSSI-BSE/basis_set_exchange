The basic idea behind the correlation consistent basis sets is that functions
which contribute approximately the same amount of correlation energy should
be grouped together when considering what mixture of s,p,d,.. etc basis
functions to use.  For hydrogen the polarization exponents were determined by
optimizing them at the SD-CI level for molecular hydrogen in its ground
state.  The (s,p) exponents for B - Ne were optimized in atomic Hartree-
Fock calculations on the ground state.  The polarization exponents were
optimized at the SD-CI level.

The Gaussian elimination algorithm used to reduce the contraction lengths was
described in an article by E.R. Davidson (Chem. Phys. Lett. 260, 514 (1996)).

Exponents for the (s)-functions taken from the calculations of Duijneveldt,
IBM Research Report RJ 945 (1971).  The polarization set was obtained by
optimizing the (p,d)-exponents in HF+1+2 calculations on the (1)Sigmag(+)
state of molecular hydrogen: first the p-exponents were optimized in the 
absence of the d-function;then the d-function was added to the set and its
exponent optimized.

The HF+1+2 calculations were carried out in D(2h) symmetry.
